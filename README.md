I havent had the time to write a proper readMe as my site had severe complications
and I´ve been busy trying to sort everything out.

The problem I have is with the register page. Somehow requests dont get returned from the 
API and results in a 500 error. So I have bascially spend all my time trying to
connect to the API. As my setup is different from the CI walktroughs, eg moments
I did not receive help from tutor support so my mentor has been my only 
guide in these matters. 
Tutor support helped me several times, but often I was refused by the tutors
due the fact to that I have a redux toolkit/react setup for my front end.    

I will continue working on it and hopefully come up with a more complete site.
